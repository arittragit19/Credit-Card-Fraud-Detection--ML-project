# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection--ML-project
This project uses logistic regression to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, under-sampling was applied to create a balanced dataset. The model achieved high accuracy on both training and test sets. Future improvements include testing advanced models and applying SMOTE.
